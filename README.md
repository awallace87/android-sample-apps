# android-sample-apps

A collection of simple Android applications, built with contemporary best practices/libraries. Meant to be an educational project and aid for myself, and other Android developers.

## Sample Apps

- Employee Directory: Sample Contacts List application, displaying a directory of sample "colleagues" along with detailed display when they are selected.
- Video Clips: Example implementation of a CameraX-based video recording application, with a simple UI for recording and playback.
- Wiki Viewer: A simple Wikipedia search application, using the Wikipedia API to search for articles and display them in a WebView.
